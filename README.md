## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elias and I've been fascinated by Programming and Computers for almost 8 years. I started off with HTML, CSS and slowly developed my skills in Javascript and PHP.
I am very interested in new technology, so I started to get comfortable with new Frontend and Backend Libraries such as React and Laravel.

Since then I tried to increase my knowledge and would describe my Skillset as following:

- **HTML, CSS, Typescript, Javascript**: Multiple years of Experience
- **PHP, MySQL**: Building simple backends with laravel and MySQL Databases
- **Python**: Several years of intensive training
- **Java**: Still learning...
